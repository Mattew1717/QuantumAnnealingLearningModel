# QuantumLearningModel
This project explores the application of Ising models to machine learning tasks. It features Python implementations (leveraging PyTorch) of Ising-based perceptrons, networks, and ensembles. The framework supports various solver backends for the Ising models, such as exact solvers, simulated annealing, and Quantum Processing Units (QPU via D-Wave).
